# TEAMWORK CONTRACT

### GOALS

1. We should choose a dataset by October 18, 2022, and start exploring the data. We should finish the exploring phase by October 25, 2022. We should finish the Project Proposal by November 3, 2022, giving us 2 days to review our proposal. If we finished earlier, we could start working on the final report and start making our conclusions.

2. For this project, we want to create an inferential question about a dataset, make conclusions, and communicate our evidence coherently, along with the uncertainties with the conclusion. We will use the techniques learnt in the course to make a well-presented electronic report about our work.

3. We want to refine our skills in selecting a good dataset and tidying the data to get the data ready to be used. We want to refine our sampling skills so that our samples are representative, generalizable, random and unbiased. We want to develop the skill of creating a good inferential question that can be generalized to a larger population accurately.

### EXPECTATIONS

1. We can have 2 meetings per week where we can talk about our progress and discuss future plans. We expect each other to be present in these meetings and, if not, give prior notice to everyone in the group so that we can make arrangements accordingly.
2. We can divide the tasks like getting the data, tidying the data and others among ourselves so that the workload is distributed accordingly. We should give at least 2 days to combine the different parts.
3. We should make internal deadlines and give weekly tasks, making it manageable for everyone with their other courses.
4. We should finish the work on time so that we have enough time to work on the refinements.

### POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

1. Post our progress in our group chat to know that the work is getting done.
2. Our project's phases should be saved so we can go back to the previous stage easily.
3. We should use a collaboratory environment like Github to save our work.
4. If there is an emergency, they should be notified to the group as soon as possible so we can make the arrangements.

### CONSEQUENCES

If the work is not done on time, we should give the person a maximum of 2 warnings. If the work is still not done, we should approach the professor or the TA with our problem.
